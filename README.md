# debiasR R Package Repository

Welcome to the **debiasR** repository!  
This package is part of the **DEBIAS** project — an international research initiative dedicated to understanding and correcting biases in human mobility data derived from mobile phone records.  

The **debiasR** package provides statistical methods and tools to generate **correction factors** for population and mobility estimates, enabling researchers and practitioners to produce **bias-adjusted human mobility data** suitable for demographic, policy and scientific applications.

The package implements a range of approaches including inverse penetration weighting, selection rate models, raking ratio adjustments, coefficient regression, and Bayesian multilevel modelling. 

Our goal is to (1) increase the reliable and ethical use of mobile phone–derived mobility for scientific and policy applications; and, (2) ensure reproducibility, transparency and comparability in the use of mobile phone–derived mobility data across contexts.
